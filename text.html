    Amidst the constantly evolving technological world that I have grown up in, computer science has been around me since a young age. With complete amazement and curiosity, I would sit alongside my cousin for hours on end, watching him use intricate code to develop softwares; I was dumbfounded by the miracle effects of this study which inspired me to dive into the world of Computer Science. The idea ​of giving the computer instructions to perform desired actions has always intrigued me. I began to pursue this interest in school when I was introduced to the C programming language in my middle school. From then on, I became drawn to computers and took every opportunity I had to learn and experiment with them​. ​This fascination has since stemmed my desire to learn more about computer programming and to pursue my ​undergrad in Computer Science and Engineering.
In 2018, ​Canadarm2 quickly became popular as the most technologically advanced piece of tech; being one of the best examples of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Canadarm2 was enough to motivate me to explore the domains of machine learning. My first project in this area of study was a “House prediction model.” This was a neural network model which, after training it with a set of data, was capable of predicting house prices accurately which ignited a spark in me to learn more about this field. Furthermore, when I attended a machine learning workshop, conducted by IEEE, focused on Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning and Data visualization during my Sophomore year of college, the intricate processes of such models further captivated my interest. That experience augmented my interest in this field as I was awestruck when introduced to the wide scope of potential discoveries.
With the freetime that the pandemic and lockdown has provided me, I have been able to explore new areas of interest by successfully completing numerous one year online courses in the span of 5 months through Coursera. The online courses included a Specialization course in Python offered by University of Michigan, a fundamentals of Data Science course offered by IBM, and two other courses which focused on Data Science using R programming offered by Johns Hopkins University.
After learning various programming languages–C/C++, JAVA, C#, and Python–by my sophomore year​, ​I finally applied those skills in my personal project by developing a “Price Comparison Website” in my junior year which was capable of extracting prices for various electronic products from all over the internet. This was made possible by implementing the concept of Data Scraping in Python with the help of Selenium webdriver, while the frontend of the website was created by using HTML and CSS. This website enabled me to better grasp programming languages such as Python and HTML/CSS, while allowing me to learn how to use the APIs of websites to retrieve the required data.
